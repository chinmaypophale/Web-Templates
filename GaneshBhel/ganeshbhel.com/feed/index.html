<div></div>
<div><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="174">A waft of freshly-cooked Indian snacks into nostrils is enough to give anyone a pang of hunger. The crispy, tangy, and savory taste of these foods is too tempting. No wonder </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="21">fast food restaurants</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="115"> are mushrooming in Pune like anything. If you are craving for fast food, here are 5 ways to make a healthy choice.</span></div>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="20">Choose small portion:</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="227">Most fast food restaurants offer small, medium, and large portion. If you want to keep your waist line in control, go for small portion. Small-sized snacks contain fewer calories, and are enough to satisfy your pangs of hunger.</span></li>
<li><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="20">Choose Indian snacks:</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="200">Indian snacks mostly use baked items than fried ones. For example, samosa and allo tikki chole chaat have baked potato as fillings. They have low calories and fat than French fries or chicken nuggets.</span></li>
<li><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="15">Veggie Sandwich:</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="174">This tasty snack is made with tomatoes, cucumbers, and potatoes as fillings and served with mint-coriander chutney. They are fast to make, nutritious, and easy on the pocket.</span></li>
<li><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="17">Healthy dressings:</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="177">Fillings, toppings, and dressings make fast food delicious. But they don&#8217;t have to add to calories. One best way to ensure healthy dressings is by going for honey mustard sauce.</span></li>
<li><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="20">Skip the side dishes:</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="202">It&#8217;s a trend with fast food restaurants to serve snacks with side dishes. If the ingredients are fried, it&#8217;s better to skip them. A virtuous choice would be light salad or a small portion of fruit dish.</span></li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="32">So next time when you visit any </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="34">best fast food restaurants in Pune</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="42">, use these tips to make a healthy choice.</span></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;">A mini-Guide to Indian Street Food</h1>
<p>Indian cuisine is amongst the most varied in the entire World. Not only that, but India has an alarming variety of quality street food, which varied from region to region and city to city. Considering that India spans 3000 kilometres from North to South and almost as much from East to West, that makes for very extensive street food, utilizing a baffling degree of ingredients. Here is a mini guide broken down in just the four directions to get you better acquainted with India&#8217;s culinary treats available on the streets!</p>
<p>North India</p>
<ul>
<li>Chaat: The first and foremost of North India&#8217;s street foods is chaat. Originating from Uttar Pradesh, Chaat is exclusively vegetarian fare comprising dishes like Aloo Tikki, Golgappa, Panipuri and Dahi Badas. The bedrock is these dishes is an excellent tamarind chutney, well-battered curd and cumin! Simple, yet tasty, Chaat is enjoyed all across India.</li>
<li>Halwai Food: Halwai is a vendor of snacks and sweets. Under this umbrella term, we can cover items like Samosa, Kachori and Pakodas. Samosas are a tasty flour dumpling filled with a spicy and tangy potato filling and then deep fried. Kachori is much the same, save the filling is usually lentils and Pakodas are either a manner of vegetable or &#8216;paneer&#8217; which are encased in a batter and then deep fried. All of these have tremendous regional variations.</li>
</ul>
<p>West India</p>
<ul>
<li>Paav Bhaaji: Originally made to serve the need of extremely fast food to serve the industrial workers in Mumbai looms, Paav bhaaji has now been adopted by India as a whole. This simple, yet tasty dish consists of a myriad of vegetable which are boiled and then mashed and cooked on a huge open pan with a combination of spices. The important thing is the consistency of the dish which is maintained by the expertise of its chef. Paav is a special bread which goes complimentary with the Bhaaji. Numerous regional variation of this dish are created.</li>
<li>Wada Paav: Easily India&#8217;s answer to the burger, this all-vegetarian fare dominates the state of Maharashtra when it comes to street food. A potato patty deep fried encased in an Indian bun called the Paav. Goes well with fried green chillies. Simple and elegant.</li>
</ul>
<p>East India</p>
<ul>
<li>Momo: Momos have now fast become a street food available all across India. Popularised by the numerous Tibetans seeking refuge in India, this food was initially limited only to the Northeast and to Bengal. Now it is everywhere with speciality stalls that sell nothing else. The filling can be vegetarian, chicken or mutton and if you happen to be in the Northeast, then they add pork in it too. Sold either steamed or fried, it goes really well with a spicy sauce made from ground red chillies.</li>
<li>Frankie: A Frankie is a roll made out of Indian flatbread, the chapati, and filled with virtually any filling that one can think of. From curry to kebabs, a Frankie is only limited by imagination and the region it finds itself in. Almost a staple across India, Frankies have grown a lot and indeed there are many speciality restaurants that sell nothing else than the humble Frankie in all its hundreds of avatars!</li>
</ul>
<p>South India</p>
<p>South India is a literal treasure trove of street food specializing in the selling of Idli, Dosa, Uttapam and Wada. All of these are made with a mixture of ground rice and lentils and are extremely healthy to boot. They are sold with a tasty &#8216;daal&#8217; called Sambhar, the preparation of which is as much tradition and it is conjecture. Along with it, there is a tangy coconut chutney and occasionally a fiery &#8216;red&#8217; chutney too.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span data-doc-id="4397000253775989">What are the reasons behind fast food’s growing popularity?</span></h1>
<p class="zw-paragraph" data-doc-id="4397000253775989">The origins of fast food are closely linked with the coming of the industrial revolution. Before the industrial revolution, the preparation and consumption of food was an activity in itself with a considerable amount of time and energy devoted to it. The industrial revolution ushered in an age where a huge workforce was concentrated in a small area and had to be fed food efficiently and speedily. Thus fast food was born and it adapted to the culinary style of whichever locale it was in. Thus England had Fish n chips while India had Pav Bhaaji. Long ignored and even looked down upon, fast food is undergoing a renaissance of its own and has developed a distinct culinary character. But that is not the only reason why fast food is gaining in popularity the world dover. Here is a list of factors that are causing that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="zw-paragraph heading105" data-header="105" data-hd-info="105" data-list-id="1" data-list-info="{&quot;id&quot;:1,&quot;l&quot;:0}">Speed: It’s called ‘Fast Food’ for a reason. The food is served extremely fast to the customers. This is because of either precooking, or an organized production line or the food itself requiring very little preparation time. Either way, its speed of service remains as its most identifiable trait along with the core reason why fast food’s popularity is growing, especially amongst the more industrialized and business oriented regions of the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="zw-paragraph heading105" data-header="105" data-hd-info="105" data-list-id="1" data-list-info="{&quot;id&quot;:1,&quot;l&quot;:0}">Cost: Fast food is much easier on the wallet than restaurants or even gourmet home cooked meals. Fast food evolved from the need to feed a large urban lower income class, and that is still reflected in its prices which are reasonable no matter where the fast food is served. That is not to say that the food itself is cheap or tasteless, it is just the way fast food is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="zw-paragraph heading105" data-header="105" data-hd-info="105" data-list-id="1" data-list-info="{&quot;id&quot;:1,&quot;l&quot;:0}">Meal between meals: Fast Food can double up as a tasty appetizer before the consumption of a larger and heartier meal at gourmet places or home. This is possible because of the size of the servings and the cost (often per plate). Snacking to gain some energy or just to enjoy a tasty morsel before the regular meal is also a prime advantage of fast food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="zw-paragraph heading105" data-header="105" data-hd-info="105" data-list-id="1" data-list-info="{&quot;id&quot;:1,&quot;l&quot;:0}">Multiple cuisines: Fast food is a new concept and as such is not bound by the traditional rules of cuisines. As such there is much mixing of various cuisines and of methods of preparation resulting in an almost global fusion of tastes. Consider the humble Shawerma which has now travelled the entire world, retaining its core preparation but always adding elements of local cuisines and tastes to it.</p>
</li>
<li>Taste!: Fast Food tastes good, period. Its preparation may involve a few foodstuffs that are not particularly healthy, but for taste, it is hard to beat. Street vendors also utilize fresh preparations that go on the flame the moment the dish is asked for, giving it a freshness that enhances the entire appeal of the dish. To add to this, there is always a variety to fast food which makes it non monotonous and exciting to try whenever the craving hits us.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="50">A guide to Product packaging for the Food Industry</span></h1>
<div></div>
<div><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="86">Packing food is as important as preparing the food is. Most people look for avenues by</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="90">which they can ensure that the freshness, flavour and the hygiene of the dish is preserved</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="88">while packaging it. This depends on quite a few factors including the consistency of the</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="94">preferred dish along with the climate it is exposed to and the natural shelf life of the item.</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="89">Below is a list of important factors that must be kept in mind while deciding on the best</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="26">packaging for a food item:</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="89">Keeping it safe: Arguably the most important of the considerations when packaging food is</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="85">to keep the encased food safe from bacteria and other sources of contamination. While</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="83">selecting a packaging based on this point, ensure that the product encased does not</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="89">suffer. For example, having a plastic encasement is not a good idea for fresh produce and</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="96">foods that utilize fresh ingredients since they like to &#8216;breathe&#8217; without which the product will</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="90">start going bad. Similarly, products with very little moisture do not need to be protected</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="84">from microorganisms as much as they need to be protected from environmental factors,</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="86">thereby ensuring they can be kept even in a paper wrap. This assumes that they will be</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="87">consumed fairly soon, or else even they will go bad. Curries and other ready foodstuffs</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="86">need a packaging that is durable and that can back up as a container for the vessel as</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="86">well. Similarly, the concern regarding fast spoiling foods is that they should not get</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="83">contaminated by microorganisms before they are consumed. Certain fish and vegetable</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="89">preparations top this list and thus due precaution must be taken against them. Similarly,</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="88">there is something like too much protection considering that a banana or an apple do not</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="83">need to be encased in any other material since their skin serves as the perfect one</span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="1"> </span><span class="zw-portion" data-text-len="7">anyway.</span></div>
<div></div>

Most people look for avenues by which they can ensure that the freshness, flavour and the hygiene of the dish is preserved while packaging it. This depends on quite a few factors including the consistency of the preferred dish along with the climate it is exposed to and the natural shelf life of the item. Below is a list of important factors that must be kept in mind while deciding on the best packaging for a food item:</p>
<p class="zw-paragraph" data-textformat="{&quot;ff&quot;:&quot;times new roman,liberation serif,serif&quot;,&quot;fgc&quot;:&quot;rgb(0,0,0)&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;12.0&quot;}" data-window-control-info="true" data-writer-border-info="{&quot;border-sides&quot;:[]}"><span class="EOP"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="zw-paragraph" data-textformat="{&quot;ff&quot;:&quot;times new roman,liberation serif,serif&quot;,&quot;fgc&quot;:&quot;rgb(0,0,0)&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;12.0&quot;}" data-window-control-info="true" data-writer-border-info="{&quot;border-sides&quot;:[]}">Keeping it safe: Arguably the most important of the considerations when packaging food is to keep the encased food safe from bacteria and other sources of contamination. While selecting a packaging based on this point, ensure that the product encased does not suffer. For example, having a plastic encasement is not a good idea for fresh produce and foods that utilize fresh ingredients since they like to &#8216;breathe&#8217; without which the product will start going bad. Similarly, products with very little moisture do not need to be protected from microorganisms as much as they need to be protected from environmental factors, thereby ensuring they can be kept even in a paper wrap. This assumes that they will be consumed fairly soon, or else even they will go bad. Curries and other ready foodstuffs need a packaging that is durable and that can back up as a container for the vessel as well. Similarly, the concern regarding fast spoiling foods is that they should not get contaminated by microorganisms before they are consumed. Certain fish and vegetable preparations top this list and thus due precaution must be taken against them. Similarly, there is something like too much protection considering that a banana or an apple do not need to be encased in any other material since their skin serves as the perfect one anyway.</li>
<li class="zw-paragraph" data-textformat="{&quot;ff&quot;:&quot;times new roman,liberation serif,serif&quot;,&quot;fgc&quot;:&quot;rgb(0,0,0)&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;12.0&quot;}" data-window-control-info="true" data-writer-border-info="{&quot;border-sides&quot;:[]}">Uniqueness: packaging is also the perfect platform to showcase the product being packaged along with the company doing the packaging and/or the food preparation. A fine line must be struck between creativity and utility, something which will ensure that a consumer takes instant notice and is pleased with the purchase as well. Certain combination meals are sold within containers that act like complete &#8216;thaali&#8217;s and also advertise the products of their parent company. The attractive packaging also appeals to the customers.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;">A mini-Guide to Indian Street Food</h1>
<p>Indian cuisine is amongst the most varied in the entire World. Not only that, but India has an alarming variety of quality street food, which varied from region to region and city to city. Considering that India spans 3000 kilometres from North to South and almost as much from East to West, that makes for very extensive street food, utilizing a baffling degree of ingredients. Here is a mini guide broken down in just the four directions to get you better acquainted with India&#8217;s culinary treats available on the streets!</p>
<p>North India</p>
<ul>
<li>Chaat: The first and foremost of North India&#8217;s street foods is chaat. Originating from Uttar Pradesh, Chaat is exclusively vegetarian fare comprising dishes like Aloo Tikki, Golgappa, Panipuri and Dahi Badas. The bedrock is these dishes is an excellent tamarind chutney, well-battered curd and cumin! Simple, yet tasty, Chaat is enjoyed all across India.</li>
<li>Halwai Food: Halwai is a vendor of snacks and sweets. Under this umbrella term, we can cover items like Samosa, Kachori and Pakodas. Samosas are a tasty flour dumpling filled with a spicy and tangy potato filling and then deep fried. Kachori is much the same, save the filling is usually lentils and Pakodas are either a manner of vegetable or &#8216;paneer&#8217; which are encased in a batter and then deep fried. All of these have tremendous regional variations.</li>
</ul>
<p>West India</p>
<ul>
<li>Paav Bhaaji: Originally made to serve the need of extremely fast food to serve the industrial workers in Mumbai looms, Paav bhaaji has now been adopted by India as a whole. This simple, yet tasty dish consists of a myriad of vegetable which are boiled and then mashed and cooked on a huge open pan with a combination of spices. The important thing is the consistency of the dish which is maintained by the expertise of its chef. Paav is a special bread which goes complimentary with the Bhaaji. Numerous regional variation of this dish are created.</li>
<li>Wada Paav: Easily India&#8217;s answer to the burger, this all-vegetarian fare dominates the state of Maharashtra when it comes to street food. A potato patty deep fried encased in an Indian bun called the Paav. Goes well with fried green chillies. Simple and elegant.</li>
</ul>
<p>East India</p>
<ul>
<li>Momo: Momos have now fast become a street food available all across India. Popularised by the numerous Tibetans seeking refuge in India, this food was initially limited only to the Northeast and to Bengal. Now it is everywhere with speciality stalls that sell nothing else. The filling can be vegetarian, chicken or mutton and if you happen to be in the Northeast, then they add pork in it too. Sold either steamed or fried, it goes really well with a spicy sauce made from ground red chillies.</li>
<li>Frankie: A Frankie is a roll made out of Indian flatbread, the chapati, and filled with virtually any filling that one can think of. From curry to kebabs, a Frankie is only limited by imagination and the region it finds itself in. Almost a staple across India, Frankies have grown a lot and indeed there are many speciality restaurants that sell nothing else than the humble Frankie in all its hundreds of avatars!</li>
</ul>
<p>South India</p>
<p>South India is a literal treasure trove of street food specializing in the selling of Idli, Dosa, Uttapam and Wada. All of these are made with a mixture of ground rice and lentils and are extremely healthy to boot. They are sold with a tasty &#8216;daal&#8217; called Sambhar, the preparation of which is as much tradition and it is conjecture. Along with it, there is a tangy coconut chutney and occasionally a fiery &#8216;red&#8217; chutney too.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Magic of Street Food</h1>
<p>Most countries of the world have their own street food which defines their culture and shows us a quick way of understanding their cuisine. In fact, if you want to understand how a country has evolved in terms of taste, and also how they cook and eat, you should first try the street food. For example, the Americans have hot dogs and pretzels, while the British, being an island country loves its fish and chips. And when you travel along the Orient in South East Asian countries like Singapore or Thailand and even Malaysia, you will find a number of exotic creatures being tossed and served along with a quick smattering of noodles.</p>
<p>In India too, we have a long standing culture of indulging in street food. Much of our street food also shows Mughal and other influences which change as you travel around the country. Samosas and jalebis are typically Indian street food and snacks that can be found in any part of the country. Yet, did you know that these have come to us with Mughal influence? Also, Bombay sandwiches and wada pav are favorites for people in the western side of the country. Chaats like gol gappas, Bhel Puri, Dahi Puri, Papdi Chaat and much more mark our street food culture. Ganesh Bhel is one of the foremost names in this industry, with a rapidly growing name in the export of Bhel and other such freshly made ingredients as well.</p>
<p>So what really is the magic of street food in India? Here is a quick look!</p>
<ul>
<li>Anytime, Anywhere: This is one of the foremost qualities of street food in India. Even before you can complete the sentence, you will find street food vendors at any and every corner. You can also walk into the street and find a vendor who can help you satiate those cravings. In the evenings, if you are out for a walk or hanging out with friends, you can very easily just stop for a bite!</li>
<li>Healthy Fare: Street food is known to be healthy and one does not have to indulge in highly oily and fatty food in order to meet those hunger pangs. A bowl of chaat or a plate of your favorite Bhel will ensure that you have munched on something that does not pack on calories or cholesterol. You can have Gol Gappas or Bhel Puri with the crunchy puffed rice in order to fill your stomach without any excess oil and fat.</li>
<li>Easy on the Pocket: When you go out there to indulge in a spot of street food magic, you will find that you have not had to drill a massive hole in your pocket! Tangy flavors and healthy eating habits that can be found in Chaat do not come for a sky high price. You can easily spend just a few bucks and get some amazing taste and flavour. This definitely beats going to restaurants and spending a bomb!</li>
</ul>
<p>So the next time you have those hunger pangs, you need to go find yourself the magic of street food in India!</p>

At Ganesh Bhel, you are sure to find the freshest and most hygienically packed Bhel. You can first take the Bhel and toss it a few times to ensure that it is fresh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="zw-paragraph" data-list-id="2" data-list-info="{&quot;id&quot;:2,&quot;l&quot;:0}" data-window-control-info="true" data-writer-border-info="{&quot;border-between&quot;:{&quot;color&quot;:&quot;rgb(0,0,0)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;0.0px&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;solid&quot;},&quot;border-sides&quot;:[&quot;border-top&quot;,&quot;border-between&quot;,&quot;border-right&quot;,&quot;insideV&quot;,&quot;border-left&quot;,&quot;border-bottom&quot;]}">The next step would be to get the main ingredients ready. Some boiled and chopped potatoes along with chopped onions and tomatoes would do the trick to add much flavor to the Bhel Puri. You can also add a hint of very finely chopped green chillies along with some flavorful coriander leaves, finely chopped too. Take all these ingredients and carefully toss them with the Bhel. Yet, you must also be careful so that you do not smash the grains as the main fun is in the delicate and crunchy grains of the puffed rice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="zw-paragraph" data-list-id="2" data-list-info="{&quot;id&quot;:2,&quot;l&quot;:0}" data-window-control-info="true" data-writer-border-info="{&quot;border-between&quot;:{&quot;color&quot;:&quot;rgb(0,0,0)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;0.0px&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;solid&quot;},&quot;border-sides&quot;:[&quot;border-top&quot;,&quot;border-between&quot;,&quot;border-right&quot;,&quot;insideV&quot;,&quot;border-left&quot;,&quot;border-bottom&quot;]}">Once you have added these chopped vegetables, you can also add some lemon juice, a few crushed papdis, mint chutney, tamarind chutney and then toss again. Take a spatula and slowly mix from side to the other without making it all too runny. The consistency should be just right. Add salt as per your taste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="zw-paragraph" data-list-id="2" data-list-info="{&quot;id&quot;:2,&quot;l&quot;:0}" data-window-control-info="true" data-writer-border-info="{&quot;border-between&quot;:{&quot;color&quot;:&quot;rgb(0,0,0)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;0.0px&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;solid&quot;},&quot;border-sides&quot;:[&quot;border-top&quot;,&quot;border-between&quot;,&quot;border-right&quot;,&quot;insideV&quot;,&quot;border-left&quot;,&quot;border-bottom&quot;]}">Finally, you can garnish with pomegranate and sev. Add some more coriander leaves on top for a play of color in the bowl of Bhel Puri, before you serve. Also sprinkle some chaat masala, black salt, cumin or jeera powder and some chili powder as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>

So how can you spice things up and have a sandwich like none other? Well, the answer is simple &#8211; you simply add some chaat. Take the filling for your sandwich &#8211; whether it is mashed potatoes or sliced and diced cucumbers and other vegetables. Add some bhel and a little mint chutney to make a yummy filling. Press between two slices of bread &#8211; and your sandwich is ready!</p>

Also, you can keep some boiled chickpeas and black beans at hand to add to the merry bowl. This will not only give you a yummy flavour, but also a healthy snack, anytime of the day. You can also add some mint and tamarind chutney to the mix along with a hint of mayonnaise or curd for a creamy yet tangy taste.</p>

You should give your typical Indian recipes a quick lift with the addition of bhel or sev as a garnish. Take the vegetable preparations with all their masala and add a topping of sev and mint chutney so that you have a crunchy texture when you dig into your meal. Indian food is know to combine a number of ingredients in order to create a wholesome meal &#8211; so why should you leave chaat behind?</p>

Add a little chutney and black salt for the perfect taste as well!</p>

Street food in India basically involves various kinds of chaat and you would do well to bring in these yummy flavors to make an unforgettable dish. Remember to carry a pack of bhel with you when you have a long day ahead &#8211; you can always simply dig into a pack of bhel to satiate those sudden cravings. This will also keep you from reaching out for oily and fatty food!</p>
